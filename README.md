# js.0x-w3cx - W3Cx-5of5-JS.0x
W3Cx: JS.0x JavaScript Introduction

## Course outline

This course is designed for anyone who is comfortable with programming concepts. No prerequisites 
are required though we encourage you to follow these two other W3Cx courses: HTML5 and CSS Fundamentals and CSS Basics.

During this course, you will learn:

  - How to add JavaScript code in your Web site/Web app, and how to debug it.
  - How to make interactive Web sites through the DOM API.
  - How to change the CSS styles of HTML5 elements from JavaScript.
  - How to deal with HTML5 forms.
  - How to make basic graphics and animations using the HTML5 canvas.

You will make good use of your JavaScript skills in the other 2 W3Cx courses included in the 
"Front-End Web Developer" W3Cx Professional Certificate program: HTML5 Coding Essentials and 
Best Practices and HTML5 Apps and Games.

In the meantime, have fun in this course!

Professional Certificate programs are series of courses designed by industry leaders and/or 
top universities to build and enhance critical professional skills needed to succeed in 
today's most in-demand fields.
 
W3C has designed a "Front-End Web Developer" (FEWD) Professional Certificate where you 
will learn all of the necessary skills needed to build interactive and responsive user 
experiences on the Web. This program will deepen your knowledge of the 3 foundational 
languages that power the Web: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. 

The W3C FEWD program is composed of 5 courses:

1.	CSS Basics
2.	HTML5 and CSS Fundamentals
3.	HTML5 Coding Essentials and Best Practices
4.	HTML5 Apps and Games
5.	This course: JavaScript Introduction

To get a W3C FEWD professional certificate, you must successfully pass and receive a Verified Certificate in the five courses above.

### Web editors
### Foreword:
###### Michel Buffa, author of this course:

"When I work locally, with files located on my computer hard drive, I use the Sublime Text source code editor, Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, NetBeans, depending on the size of the project I'm working on.
- For testing simple examples, I mainly use the JsBin.com online code editor.
- For embedding online examples in this course, I use the CodePen.io online code editor.
- For choosing a CSS color, shadow, text-shadow, gradients, etc. I use the LiveWeave online code editor."

Traditional source code editors
You can use any source code editor that has good support for HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. For this course, you are free to use whichever you prefer. However, there are some in particular that we recommend.
Sublime Text is a very powerful, multi-platform source code editor, it's semi-free (you can use it without paying, it will pop up a dialog asking you to buy it once in a while, but not very often). Sublime text supports hundreds of plugins to enhance its features.

**Visual Studio Code** is a free, open source, multi-platform editor by Microsoft.

## Other tools

### Free of charge:
- Atom source code editor (note that Visual Studio code is based on Atom).
- Brackets source code editor.
- NotePad++ (Windows only)
- NetBeans and Eclipse: very powerful IDEs (integrated development environments), but heavier than all the "lightweight" source editors that we've talked about so far. More dedicated to "mid-size/large-size projects", more for pro developers that are also looking for good support for server-side languages such as Java, Python, PHP, etc.

### Not free of charge:

- IDEs by JetBrains.com have a very good reputation and can be obtained for free if you are an academic customer (student or teacher). The WebStorm IDE is a very good mid-weight tool for developing HTML/CSS/JS/NodeJS code.
- BBedit (for Macs): source code editor for mac with support for Web languages.

### Online editors/IDEs
To help you practice for the duration of the course, you will use the following tools:
JS Bin is an open-source collaborative Web development debugging tool. Most of the examples you will find in this course are either on JSBin or on CodePen.

Tutorials can be found on the Web (such as these ones) or on YouTube. The tool is really simple: just open the link to the provided examples, look at the code, look at the result, etc. And you can modify the examples as you like, you can also modify / clone / save / share them. Keep in mind that it's always better to be logged in (it's free) if you do not want to lose your work.
In our opinion, JSBin is the best online IDE for "live coding": typing and seeing what you are doing in real time, monitoring error messages in the console tab, and debugging your code. We will mainly use this tool for the live coding videos.
 
CodePen is similar to JSBin except that its Web site includes a search engine, which is very useful for finding out what others have developed. Looking for a nice HTML5/CSS button style? Just search for "button", etc. It's also easier for us to embed HTML/CSS/JS examples in this course with CodePen than with other online IDEs; this is why so many "pens" are embedded in the course pages.

This is a great service to get you started quickly as it doesn't require you to download anything and you can access it, along with your saved projects from any Web browser. Here's an article which will be of-interest if you use CodePen: Things you can do with CodePen [Brent Miller, February 6, 2019].
 
Plunker allows us to work online with separate files. So, when we have no choice but to use separate files, we might use this tool.

 
LiveWeave is great for writing CSS code or for embedding SVG Graphics in an HTML document, as it includes online wizards and interactive editors. We use it when we have problems with CSS shadows, CSS colors or gradients, or when we want to include an SVG arrow in a document.
 
 
 
JSFiddle is very similar to JSBin and CodePen in terms of features. 
Other tools
There are many other online IDEs and new ones appear each year. If you want a real, heavyweight online IDE that has nearly all the features offered by "big IDEs" such as Eclipse, NetBeans and WebStorm, take a look at the Cloud9 IDE. It's free and will enable you to develop huge projects, that can include many files, it supports uploaded assets such as images, videos and sound files.  Furthermore, like Google Docs, it will support multiple users working at the same time on the same project, even on the same file. It's a real collaborative environment.
Michel Buffa, author of this course, developed a whole multitrack audio player this way. This application is available online. See also screenshots below:
 
100% of the development was done in a Web browser, by Michel Buffa and two friends, using the c9.io (Cloud 9) IDE (to see if online IDEs were a valuable approach):
 
### JavaScript debuggers

Here is a selection of tools to help debug JavaScript code. The instructor will indicate other tools in module 1 of the course.
- Firefox JS debugger (debugger shipped inside Firefox) - all other browsers have integrated debuggers as well.
- JS Lint  - The JavaScript Code Quality Tool
- CodeBeautify  - JavaScript Validator
- Check also other JavaScript debugging tools

### Browser compatibility

The term browser compatibility refers to the ability of a given Web site to appear fully functional on the browsers available in the market.
The most powerful aspect of the Web is what makes it so challenging to build for: its universality. When you create a Web site, you’re writing code that needs to be understood by many different browsers on different devices and operating systems!
To make the Web evolve in a sane and sustainable way for both users and developers, browser vendors work together to standardize new features, whether it’s a new HTML element, CSS property, or JavaScript API. But different vendors have different priorities, resources, and release cycles — so it’s very unlikely that a new feature will land on all the major browsers at once. As a Web developer, this is something you must consider if you’re relying on a feature to build your site.
We are then providing references to the browser support of HTML5 features presented in this course using 2 resources: Can I Use and Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Docs.
Can I use
Can I Use provides up-to-date tables for support of front-end Web technologies on desktop and mobile Web browsers. Below is a snapshot of what information is given by CanIUse when searching for "CSS3 colors".
 
### MDN Web Docs
  
To help developers make these decisions consciously rather than accidentally, MDN Web Docs provides browser compatibility tables in its documentation pages, so that when looking up a feature you’re considering for your project, you know exactly which browsers will support it.

### W3C validators
For over 20 years, the W3C has been developing and hosting free and open source tools used every day by millions of Web developers and Web designers. All the tools listed below are Web-based, and are available as downloadable sources or as free services on the W3C Developers tools site.

### W3C Validator
The W3C validator checks the markup validity of various Web document formats, such as HTML.

### CSS Validator
The CSS validator checks Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and (X)HTML documents that use CSS stylesheets.

### Unicorn
Unicorn is W3C's unified validator, which helps people improve the quality of their Web pages by performing a variety of checks. Unicorn gathers the results of the popular HTML and CSS validators, as well as other useful services, such as RSS/Atom feeds and http headers.

### Link Checker
The W3C Link Checker looks for issues in links, anchors and referenced objects in a Web page, CSS style sheet, or recursively on a whole Web site. For best results, it is recommended to first ensure that the documents checked use valid HTML Markup and CSS.

### Internationalization Checker
The W3C Internationalization Checker provides information about various internationalization-related aspects of your page, including the HTTP headers that affect it. It also reports a number of issues and offers advice about how to resolve them.

### W3C cheatsheet
https://dev.w3.org/2009/cheatsheet/doc/
The W3C cheatsheet provides quick access to useful information from a variety of specifications published by W3C. It aims at giving in a very compact and mobile-friendly format a compilation of useful knowledge extracted from W3C specifications, completed by summaries of guidelines developed at W3C, in particular Web accessibility guidelines, the Mobile Web Best Practices, and a number of internationalization tips.

Its main feature is a lookup search box, where one can start typing a keyword and get a list of matching properties/elements/ attributes/functions in the above-mentioned specifications, and further details on those when selecting the one of interest.


### The W3C cheatsheet is only available as a pure Web application.

### Help build the Web Platform!
Most of the technologies you use when developing Web applications and Web sites are designed and standardized in W3C in a completely open and transparent process.
In fact, all W3C specifications are developed in public GitHub repositories, so if you are familiar with GitHub, you already know how to contribute to W3C specifications! This is all about raising issues (with feedback and suggestions) and/or bringing pull requests to fix identified issues.

Contribute
Contributing to this standardization process might be a bit scary or hard to approach at first, but understanding at a deeper level how these technologies are built is a great way to build your expertise.
If you're looking to an easy way to dive into this standardization processes, check out which issues in the W3C GitHub repositories have been marked as "good first issue" and see if you find anything where you think you would be ready to help.
First steps in Web accessibility
As steward of global Web standards, W3C's mission is to safeguard the openness, accessibility, and freedom of the World Wide Web from a technical perspective.
W3C's primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web. The widely adopted Web standards define key parts of what actually makes the World Wide Web work.
Shape the future
Another approach is to go and bring feedback on ideas for future technologies: the W3C Web Platform Community Incubator Group was built as an easy place to get started to provide feedback on new proposals or bring brand-new proposals for consideration.
Happy Web building!
What is W3C?
As steward of global Web standards, W3C's mission is to safeguard the openness, accessibility, and freedom of the World Wide Web from a technical perspective.
W3C's primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web. The widely adopted Web standards define key parts of what actually makes the World Wide Web work.
A few history bits
 
Tim Berners-Lee at his desk in CERN, 1994
Tim Berners-Lee wrote a proposal in 1989 for a system called the World Wide Web. He then created the first Web browser, server, and Web page. He wrote the first specifications for URLs, HTTP, and HTML.
In October 1994, Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Laboratory for Computer Science [MIT/LCS] in collaboration with CERN, where the Web originated (see information on the original CERN Server), with support from DARPA and the European Commission.
In April 1995, Inria became the first European W3C host, followed by Keio University of Japan (Shonan Fujisawa Campus) in Asia in 1996. In 2003, ERCIM took over the role of European W3C Host from Inria. In 2013, W3C announced Beihang University as the fourth Host.
As of January 2023, W3C is a public-interest non-profit organization incorporated in the United States of America, led by a Board of Directors and employing a global staff across the globe
A few figures
As of July 2023, W3C:
•	Is a member-driven organization composed of over 360 companies, universities, start-ups, etc. from all over the world.
•	Holds 52 technical groups, including Working and Interest Groups where technical specifications are discussed and developed.
•	Published over 13585 published technical reports, including 510 Web standards (or W3C Recommendations) - since January 1st,1995.
•	Runs a translation program to foster the translation of its specifications: see the translation matrix currently listing 312 available translations of W3C recommendations.
•	Hosts 143 Community and Business Groups, where developers, designers, and anyone passionate about the Web have a place to hold discussions and publish ideas.
•	Gathers over13860active participants constituting the W3C community.
•	Has a technical staff composed of 46 people, spread on all five continents.
W3C's core values
Committed to core values of an open Web that promotes innovation, neutrality, and interoperability, W3C and its community are setting the vision and standards for the Web, ensuring the building blocks of the Web are open, accessible, secure, international and have been developed via the collaboration of global technical experts.
The Web is amazing!
Level 2 headings may be created by course providers in the future.
People often use the words "Internet" and "Web" interchangeably, but this usage is technically incorrect.
The Web is an application of the Internet. The Web is the most popular way of accessing the Internet, but other applications of the Internet are e-mail and ftp for example. One analogy equates the Internet to a road network where the Web is a car, the email is a bicycle, etc.  Read this article for more details about the difference between Internet and the Web.
Check also this reminder ;)
 
The W3C community is passionate about creating free and open Web standards. The next video, created in partnership with Microsoft, explains why standards are important to maintain a royalty-free, Open Web Platform, as well as to help shape the Web of the future.
Why accessibility is important
The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.
Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web
When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them. However, currently many sites and tools are developed with accessibility barriers that make them difficult or impossible for some people to use.
Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create high-quality websites and web tools, and not exclude people from using their products and services.
Making the web accessible benefits people with and without disabilities, businesses, and society. Accessibility is an important aspect of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).
Video Introduction to Web Accessibility and W3C Standards is a 4-minute video with descriptive transcript and subtitles in over 20 languages.
Who is impacted?
Web accessibility addresses all disabilities, including hearing, learning and cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. Some examples of Web accessibility features include:
•	Captions on audio and multimedia content for people who are hard of hearing;
•	Clear and consistent layout for people with learning and cognitive disabilities;
•	Keyboard support for people with physical disabilities and do not use a mouse;
•	Text alternatives for people with visual disabilities and using screen readers;
Web accessibility benefits people with and without disabilities
Web accessibility features also benefit many more users, such as:
•	People with temporary situational limitations, such as a broken arm;
•	People using mobile devices, televisions, and other access channels;
•	People using older computers, with low bandwidth, and other limitations;
•	People who are new to computers, to the Web, or to your own website;
•	People who are not fluent in the language of your particular website;
The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. When Web pages, Web technologies, Web tools, or Web applications are badly designed, they can create barriers that exclude people from using the Web. More information is available in the W3C Accessibility overview.
First steps in Web accessibility
There are many simple Web accessibility improvements that you can implement and check right away, even when you are new to this topic. Two example excerpts are provided below on this page but you can find more tips and information from W3C/WAI:
•	Tips for Getting Started with Web Accessibility
•	Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility
Example 1: page title
Good page titles are particularly important for orientation — to help people know where they are and move between pages open in their browser. The first thing screen readers say when the user goes to a different Web page is the page title. In the Web page markup, they are the <title> within the <head>.
Check #1: There is a title that adequately and briefly describes the content of a page, and that it distinguishes the page from other Web pages.
Example:
<head>
...
   <title>Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) - home page</title>
...
</head>
Example 2: image text alternatives ("alt text")
Text alternatives ("alt text") are a primary way of making visual information accessible, because they can be rendered through any sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user. Providing text alternatives allows the information to be rendered in a variety of ways by a variety of user agents. For example, a person who cannot see a picture can have the text alternative read aloud using synthesized speech.
Check #2: Every image has alt with appropriate alternative text.
Example: See the W3C logo below. It contains a link that points to the W3C Web site. The text alternative is going to be a brief description of the link target.
<a href="https://w3.org">
   <img src="https://w3.org/Icons/w3c_home.png" width="72" height="48" alt="W3C Web site">
</a>
Why internationalization is important
Access to the Web for all has been a fundamental concern and goal of the W3C since the beginning. It is easy to overlook the needs of people from cultures different to your own, or who use different languages or writing systems, but you have to ensure that any content or application that you design or develop is ready to support the international features that they will need.
'Internationalization' is sometimes abbreviated to 'i18n' in English, because there are 18 characters between the 'i' and the 'n'.
The W3C Internationalization Activity works with W3C working groups and liaises with other organizations to make it possible to use Web technologies with different languages, scripts, and cultures.
During this course you will learn about some basic internationalization features, such as character encoding and language declarations. If you don't use those features you will create barriers for people from different cultures who are trying to access your content. This is important even if you think you are only designing for a specific community – communities are made up of diverse individuals, and the Web stretches worldwide.
Unicode
Text in a computer or on the Web is composed of characters. 
Characters represent letters of the alphabet, punctuation, or other symbols.
Unicode is a universal character set, ie. a standard that defines, in one place, all the characters needed for writing languages in use on computers. It is a superset of all other character sets that have been encoded.
As a content author or developer, It is important to clearly distinguish between the concepts of a character set versus a character encoding. You should nowadays always choose the UTF-8 character encoding for your content or data. This Unicode encoding is a good choice because you can use a single encoding to handle any character you are likely to meet. This greatly simplifies things.
Essential steps in Web i18n
You find below three examples (and checks!) to help you to ensure that your Web page works for people around the world, and to make it work differently for different cultures, where needed. Let's meet the words 'charset' and 'lang', soon to become your favorite markup ;)
Example 1: Character encoding declaration
A character encoding declaration is vital to ensure that the text in your page is recognized by browsers around the world, and not garbled. You will learn more about what this is, and how to use it as you work through the course.  For now, just ensure that it's always there.
Check #1: There is a character encoding declaration near the start of your source code, and  its value is UTF-8.
Example 1:
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8"/>
...
</head>
Example 2: Primary language declaration
For a wide variety of reasons, it's important for a browser to know what language your page is written in, including font selection, text-to-speech conversion, spell-checking, hyphenation and automated line breaking, text transforms, automated translation, and more. You should always indicate the primary language of your page in the <html> tag. Again you will learn how to do this during the course.  You will also learn how to change the language, where necessary, for parts of your document that are in a different language.
Check #2: The HTML tag has a lang attribute which correctly indicates the language of your content.
Example 2: This indicates that the page is in French.
<!doctype html>
<html lang="fr">
<head>
...
Example 3: Cultural bias
People around the world don't always understand cultural references that you are familiar with, for example the concept of a 'home run' in baseball, or a particular type of food. You should be careful when using examples to illustrate ideas. Also, people in other cultures don't necessarily identify with pictures that you would recognize, for example, hand gestures can have quite unexpected meanings in other parts of the world, and photos of people in a group may not be representative of populations elsewhere.  When creating forms for capturing personal details, you will quickly find that your assumptions about how personal names and addresses work are very different from those of people from other cultures.
Check #3: If your content will be seen by people from diverse cultures, check that your cultural references will be recognized and that there is no inappropriate cultural bias.
Don't worry!
The following 7 quick tips summarize some important concepts of international Web design. They will become more meaningful as you work through the course, so come back and review this page at the end.
1.	Encoding: use the UTF-8 (Unicode) character encoding for content, databases, etc. Always declare the encoding.
2.	Language: declare the language of documents and indicate internal language changes.
3.	Navigation: on each page include clearly visible navigation to localized pages or sites, using the target language.
4.	Escapes: use characters rather than escapes (e.g. &#xE1; &#225; or &aacute;) whenever you can.
5.	Forms: use UTF-8 on both form and server. Support local formats of names/addresses, times/dates, etc.
6.	Localizable styling: use CSS styling for the presentational aspects of your page. So that it's easy to adapt content to suit the typographic needs of the audience, keep a clear separation between styling and semantic content, and don't use 'presentational' markup.
7.	Images, animations & examples: if your content will be seen by people from diverse cultures, check for translatability and inappropriate cultural bias.
You will find more quick tips on the Internationalization quick tips page. Remember that these tips do not constitute complete guidelines.
Internationalization checker
When you start creating Web pages, you can also run them through the W3C's Internationalization Checker.  If there are internationalization problems with your page, this checker explains what they are and what to do about it.
1.1.1 Introduction - Module 1: Intro to JavaScript (1:46)
Hello everyone, welcome to the wonderful world of JavaScript!
In this module, after giving a brief history of JavaScript and Web browsers, we will explain how HTML, CSS and JavaScript are related to one another. We will see JavaScript in action through numerous interactive examples. We have made sure that all examples can be run directly in the course’s Web pages. 
Hey, we’re teaching Web technologies, after all! We will do that throughout the course, as you will be asked to change some code, tweak this or that example, even if the code details are not fully explained at first. Because, this is how we recommend beginners to learn JavaScript: first look at examples, then tweak some code and see the results of the changes. You will certainly encounter error messages, but no worries, as I will teach you how to debug JavaScript code using your browser’s devtool console.
In this first module, you will also learn about JavaScript variables, operators and expressions, and have a first lesson about functions, objects, arrays and strings.
These are the basic concepts of JavaScript and are shared by many other programming languages. We’ll then develop together, and step by step, an interactive graphic tool that will use many different features from JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Let’s start having fun with JavaScript, now :-)
1.1.2 Module 1 outline
If you thought that a Web browser could only display HTML documents, you were mistaken! ;)
Behind the scenes, an HTML document is nearly always associated with two other standard languages of the Web: CSS and JavaScript. Before looking at the guts of JavaScript, we introduce the basics and play with many examples. We will also have a first look at the browser devtools, and discover how JavaScript is useful.
•	First, let's briefly discuss the roles of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and how they work together.
•	We show examples of what can be done with JavaScript: a showcase of very small examples through to impressively complex ones.
•	Then we look at a dozen different - very small - examples of typical uses of JavaScript.
•	Finally, we learn how to use the browser devtools, a powerful, built-in set of tools that represent the Swiss army knife of any Web developer. Without the devtools, you would not be able to debug your code, find errors, print traces of what a JavaScript program is doing etc.
A word of caution: you will not learn JavaScript in full detail in this course! This is an introductory course designed to help you understand the basic concepts of the language.
1.2.1 HTML is for structure
The "Hyper Text" part: links!
A fundamental key to the World Wide Web is the concept of "hypertext". Hypertext is built on the idea of linking information together, not unlike using footnotes, but far easier and more flexible. The idea is to "mark up" your document with links and define how to break it down into different segments  (chapters, sections, paragraphs, tables, figures, etc.)
That's why, in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee began to create a definition of HTML: Hypertext Markup Language, to provide a simple, uniform way to incorporate hyperlinks into a text document.
 
He envisioned a technology that would facilitate thoroughly interconnected documents. He wanted authors to be able to connect an idea in one document to the source of the idea in another, or connect a statement with the data that backs up that statement. Traditionally this kind of thing was done with footnotes and bibliographies, which can be cumbersome. This information should be easily transferable from one place to another, so that in reading one document, it is easy to access everything related (linked) to it. Tim Berners-Lee imagined a "Web" of interconnected documents.
He used the metaphor of a Web to emphasize the importance of connections between documents. It was not just a long list of details, but rather a sea of information stretching out in all directions. This sea of information was navigated by a new tool called a "browser".
The "Markup" part: elements, tags and attributes!
The "M" in HTML stands for "Markup", but what does Markup really mean?  Essentially it means to annotate a document with extra information: things like where different sections and paragraphs begin and end, which part is the title, which things should be emphasized and so on.
There are many ways to markup a document, but HTML borrows a technique from an ancestor language, SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), which uses angle brackets ("<" and ">") to separate the annotations from the regular text.  In HTML these annotations are called "tags".
For example, consider the following chunk of HTML code (note: you can edit the source code and see the resulting Web page updating in real time):

HTML
<body>
<h1>A Tale of Two Cities</h1>
<p>
  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, . . . .
</p>
. . .
<p>
  . . . it is a far, far better rest
  that I go to than I have ever known.
</p>
</body>
If you eliminated everything in between the angle brackets from the text, for most purposes it would still read the same:
A Tale of Two Cities
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times . . . .
. . .
. . . it is a far, far better rest
that I go to than I have ever known.
Once you know that everything in angle brackets is "meta-information", it gives you a lot of flexibility. You can put a lot of different things in between those brackets without any of it showing up (directly) in your finished document. And though you don't usually see directly what's in those angle brackets, they can often have a big effect on how your Web page looks, as well as how it responds and interacts with you.
Here is another, more generic example:
Notes:
•	Remember that the first line of your HTML5 page should start by <!DOCTYPE html>. CodePen does not force you to add a DOCTYPE on CodePen, but be assured that you have to specify the DOCTYPE in all your Web documents.
•	You can modify the source code in CodePen, and see the results in real time.

Try it out!
It's time to write your first HTML code :-)
You can use a source code editor like Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets or any lightweight text editor. You can also use more "professional" tools such as Visual Studio Code, NetBeans, Eclipse, WebStorm, etc.
To try out the simple examples from this course, I'd suggest using an online IDE such as JSBin, CodePen, Plunker, etc.
During the course, we will show you how to test out simple code snippets in online IDEs, but we will also teach you how to organize your code with folders and files.
The next lesson shows how you can use JSBin, CodePen, and SublimeText in order to test the HTML code provided earlier in this section.
